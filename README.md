Hello, I'm Lydia. I'm using GitHub to explore WEB Technologies, IT suppurt and programmming. This exploration will increase my sklls as a computer professional. Knowing how things work improves ones ability to use tools and applications based on these technologies.

I'm learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript and Shell programming. My desire is to become an IT progrssional. I have an awesome teacher [ ancientwizad ].
